This demonstrates the iterator pattern

We can see that if we want to see all of our songs normally, we must make 3 different loops iterating
through each individual set of songs. These all use different data structures, too, meaning our
implementations between loops are different

However, using the iterator pattern, we obscure these differences in by handling iteration
within each class using universal iterators from that package, which can handle all sorts of data structs.

Also, the fact that each category implements SongIterator means we can group them together with no
complications.

So, the DJ iterates through each category of songs not manually but by accessing iterators that these
objects return over themselves.
